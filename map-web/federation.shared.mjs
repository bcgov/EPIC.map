/**
 * Modules this host provides to the map remote rather than letting it ship its
 * own copy.
 *
 * A copy of packages/epic-map/federation.shared.mjs, and it has to stay one -
 * see the note at the bottom. It is duplicated rather than imported on purpose:
 * this application no longer compiles anything out of packages/epic-map, and
 * its Docker build does not even copy that directory in. Reaching across for a
 * config file would put the coupling back that federation was adopted to
 * remove, and would not help the hosts in other repositories at all.
 *
 * Module Federation negotiates these at load time: the host offers what it has,
 * the remote offers what it has, and the highest version that satisfies both
 * sides wins. A module only one side declares is not shared at all - it is
 * quietly loaded twice.
 *
 * `singleton` is not an optimisation here, it is a correctness requirement.
 * React throws "invalid hook call" the moment two copies are live, and every
 * context that has to cross the host/remote seam - emotion's cache, MUI's theme -
 * is identity-compared against the module that created it. A second copy of any
 * of these renders an unthemed map at best.
 *
 * `strictVersion` is deliberately left off (it defaults to false), so a host on
 * MUI 5.15.19 against our 5.15.20 gets a warning and a working map rather than a
 * hard failure. The versions below are the floors this widget is written
 * against, not pins.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT shared:
 *   maplibre-gl - 800kB no host has a use for, and sharing it would let a host's
 *     copy win the negotiation, which moves `import.meta.url` to the host's
 *     origin and leaves the web worker behind (see maplibreWorkerAssets in
 *     vite.config.ts).
 *   axios - the widget's client is private, interceptors and all, and a shared
 *     copy buys nothing but a way for a host's interceptors to see our tokens.
 *   @mui/icons-material - a shared module is provided whole, so sharing the icon
 *     barrel means shipping all ~11,000 of them: 4.3MB of chunk for the dozen
 *     this widget draws. Icons hold no state and cross no context - they are
 *     plain components over @mui/material's createSvgIcon, which IS shared - so
 *     leaving them out costs nothing and lets tree-shaking do its job.
 *
 * This is a plain .mjs rather than TypeScript because scripts/check-shared-modules.mjs
 * imports it and the widget's copy directly and checks that the two still agree.
 * Nothing else would catch a disagreement: the two are built separately and
 * never see each other until a browser loads both.
